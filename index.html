          Software Engineer with an expertise in Android development and experience with iOS, Frontend, and Backend development.
          After graduating from the University of Texas at Dallas, I joined a
          small company in Dallas. I worked as part of their Android and iOS
          development team. We developed applications for a variety of companies
          as well as in house projects. After five years, I left to move closer
          to family. I've since taken up smaller projects and contracts. One of the most
          recent projects is for Curate LA. It is a small startup based here in
          Los Angeles. We help art connoisseurs find their local art gallery
          openings and exhibitions. Please check out our android application:
