          I am an Android and iOS developer with some Frontend and Backend experience. 
          After graduating from the University of Texas at Dallas, I joined a
          small company in Dallas. I worked as part of their Android and iOS
          development team. We developed applications for a variety of companies
          as well as in house projects. After five years, I left to move closer
          to family. I've since taken up smaller projects and contracts. Most
          recently of which is Curate LA. It is a small startup based here in
          Los Angeles. We help art connoisseurs find their local art gallery
          openings and exhibitions. Please check out our application:

          >! I also do web development for Delvefore. We develope Web applications with VueJS. 
          I'm open to opportunities in the Orange County area or remote.
